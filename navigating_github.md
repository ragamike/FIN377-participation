# Golden Rules


| Category |  Rule |
|----------|-------|
|0. PLAN BEFORE YOU CODE|"Pseudo code" is writing out the broad steps in plain language. I often (almost always for complicated tasks) do this on paper, then translate it to code as an outline (in the code's comments). |
|Automation | Automate everything that can be automated, don't do point-and-click analysis!|
|Version Control|A. Store code and data under version control. Revisit the GitHub workflow recipe as needed! B. Before checking the directory back in, clear all outputs and temp files and then run the whole directory! (Check: Did it work right?) |
|Directories	|A. Separate directories by function B. Separate files into inputs and outputs C. Make directories portable|
|Keys / Units	|A. Store cleaned data in tables with unique, non-missing "keys" B. Keep data normalized as far into your code pipeline as you can|
|Abstraction|	A. Abstract to eliminate redundancy B. Abstract to improve clarity C. Otherwise, don't abstract D. Unit test your functions! E. Don't use magic numbers, define once as variables and refer as needed|
|Documentation|	A. Is good... to a point B. Don't write documentation you will not maintain C. Code is better off when it is self-documenting|
|Randoms|“NEVER DRAW RANDOM NUMBERS WITHOUT A SEED”.|
