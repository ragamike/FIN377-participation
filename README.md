# FIN377-participation-3pm
Learning GitHub

The following repository contains a comprehensive overview of the material learned in FIN-377 at Lehigh University. Throughout the semester, students taking this course have learned a myriad of topics that pertain to data analytics. These topics include data wrangling, data cleaning, data organization, visualizations, web scraping, crawling URLS, linear regressions, and machine learning. To successfully explore these topics, numerous packages were necessary to utilize specific functions. These packages include pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, requests, tdqm, beautifulSoup, sm_ols, and more. The following repository is broken into 4 main folders and a markdown file. Here's what you can find in them: 

### Livecoding

The following folder contains the majority of assignments created throughout the semester. It is organized chronologically in how they were created throughout the semester, and in a way, increase in difficulty as it progresses. The assignments are all run prior to being submitted so the results can be observed without having to download the file and running it on your own accord. 

There is a .gitignore created in this repository that pertains to the web crawler folder inside of this folder. This is because the web crawler creates a new folder with 505 .txt files when run. To not inconvenience anyone who decides to open this repository on their computer out of self interest, they will not have the 505 .txt files automatically downloaded onto their computer, and can instead receive them by executing the web crawler file. 

### Homework

The following folder contains a few exercises students were expected to complete either before the end of class or before attending the next session. They tested critical thinking in their respective topics that transcended what we accomplished in class. Most homeworks were reviewed in the following class and do not usually contain only one correct answer. They are a test of efficiency and creativity.

### Codebook

The following folder contains a single .ipynb file named "Cheatsheet". This file was updated at my personal discretion throughout the semester. It serves as a reference in multiple accounts. First, it contains a list of links relating to future coding assignments I've found interesting in addition to articles that have given me a better understanding on topics I've struggled with throughout the semester. Next is a list of libraries used throughout the semester and what their purpose is. Finally, the bulk of the file contains bits of code to remind me how to accomplish specific tasks. These schemas are an efficient way of recording specific functions that I've either struggled to understand or implement.

### Misc

The following folder contains all remaining files that were created throughout the semester but do not belong in the above mentioned folders. They were either created to further explore specific subject areas or simply were not required for this participation assignment.

## Other

### navigating_github.md

This markdown is intended to display four tasks we were given. The first provides a list of URL's that are relevant to FIN-377 and navigating github. They served as useful reference material when I had minimal understanding of how information was organized. The next task is scattered throughout the markdown, but it was to use a minimum of 4 markdown features. The examples I used included created links, making headers, highlighting words, and using a strikethrough in a phrase. The next is a how to. The line of code provided grants me direct access to my repository when executed in my terminal. Finally, the last is a table of Golden Rules for the entire coding process. These guidelines are important reminders on how to plan for assignemnts, analyze problems, and complete an appropriate documentation write up when finished.
